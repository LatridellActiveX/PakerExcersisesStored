          <p>
            <strong id="hook">New World</strong> is a massively multiplayer
            online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Amazon Games Orange
            County and published by Amazon Games released on September 28,
            2021.[2][3][4] The game was previously scheduled to release in May
            2020 and subsequently August 2021, but was delayed until its
            worldwide release on September 28, 2021.[5][6] Set in the
            mid-seventeenth century, players colonize a fictional land modeled
            after the Americas.[7]

          <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
          <p>
            The players may form groups of up to five members, join one of three
            factions (Marauders, Syndicate, or Covenant), gather raw materials
            (wood, stone, animal skins etc.) from resource nodes, craft items,
            gain control over settlements, quest, explore the world, or fight
            other players or monsters.[12]
          </p>
          <h3>Combat and Weapons</h3>
          <p>
            The gameplay involves no auto-locked targeting attacks and,
            therefore, a steady hand at aiming is required. With each level, the
            hostile mobs are programmed with increasingly complex and strong
            sequences of attacking behavior skill sets that will require the
            player to counter using their mana, stamina, and health with timed
            attacks, dodges, weapon blocks, retreats, or crawling stealth. The
            weapon skill tree choices are currently for bow, hammer, hatchet,
            great axe, fire staff, life staff, musket, blunderbuss,[13]
            spear,[14] sword/shield, ice gauntlet, void gauntlet, flail, and
            great sword.[15]

            New World was first revealed in September 2016, at TwitchCon. Amazon
            Game Studios announced they would be working on their first three PC
            games: Breakaway, Crucible and New World.[17] In March 2018,
            Breakaway was cancelled, leaving the teams to focus on the other two
            titles,[18] and on October 9, 2020, Relentless Studios announced the
            cancellation of Crucible, citing the inability to see a sustained
            future as the reason for cancellation.[19] The studio shifted to aid
            development of New World instead.[20] On February 16, 2021, it was
            announced that the game is set to release on August 31, 2021.[4]

          <p>
            New World received "mixed or average" reviews according to review
            aggregator Metacritic.[35] It was nominated for Best Multiplayer
            Game at The Game Awards 2021.[40] During 2021, New World managed to
            position itself in the top played games of Steam.[41][42]
